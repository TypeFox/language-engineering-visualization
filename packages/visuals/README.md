# Visuals

Simple examples showing various visualizations of Langium-derived ASTs. This includes statemachine, domain model, arithmetics, minilogo, and Langium itself. The later has a very complex AST graph, leading a visual to be a good way to get a macro-level assessment of its structure.

Examples can be viewed like so:
```bash
npm run build
npm run serve
# view on localhost:3000
# will show a series of graphs on the same page, with each taking up a full page-size.
```
