# Langium HAT (Helpers for AST Transformations)

A helpful package for AST transformations from Langium-based languages.

The goal of this package is to keep it as simple as possible to turn Langium-based language ASTs into workable data.
Provided you have a working Langium-based language, you can add the langium-hat to your project and start using it immediately to consume AST data.

Can be used for the purposes of:
- data analysis on ASTs
- graphing of AST structures
- visualizations tied to ASTs
- any other applications that need to consume AST-derived data
